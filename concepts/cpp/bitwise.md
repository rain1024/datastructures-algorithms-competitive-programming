# Bitwise

From wikipedia

> In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.

**Bitwise Operators**

|                | Definition                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| NOT            | NOT(1) = 0, NOT(0) = 1                  |
| AND            | 1 AND 1 = 1, 1 AND 0 = 0                |
| OR             | 1 OR 0 = 1, 0 OR 0 = 0                  |
| XOR            | 1 XOR 0 = 0, 1 XOR 1 = 1, O XOR  0 = 0  |

**Bitwise Shift**

|                 | Definition                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| LEFT SHIFT      | LEFT_SHIFT(1101) = 110     |
| RIGHT SHIFT     | RIGHT_SHIFT(1101) = 11010  |
