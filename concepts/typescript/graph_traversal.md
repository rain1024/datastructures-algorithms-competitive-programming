# Graph Traversal

From neo4j document

> Graph search (or graph traversal) algorithms explore a graph for general discovery or explicit search. They will try to visit as much of the graph as they can reach, but there is no expectation that the paths they explore are computationally optimal.

## Depth-first search (DFS)

From wikipedia

> Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
