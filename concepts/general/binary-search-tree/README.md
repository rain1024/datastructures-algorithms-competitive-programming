A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, usually referred to as left and right children. In a binary search tree, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of all nodes in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values of all nodes in its right subtree.

Binary search trees are often used for searching and sorting algorithms because they have a time complexity of O(log n) for most operations, including searching, insertion, and deletion, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. However, the performance of a binary search tree can degrade to O(n) in the worst case scenario, such as when the tree is unbalanced. To maintain optimal performance, it is important to balance the tree periodically or use a self-balancing binary search tree.

## Binary Search Tree Operations

Here are some basic operations that you can perform on binary search trees:

* Insertion: Insert a new node into the tree
* Deletion: Delete a node from the tree
* Searching: Search for a node in the tree
