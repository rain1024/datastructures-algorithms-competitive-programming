In competitive programming, programmers use strings or arrays to store and manipulate sequences of characters. This data structure is straightforward, fast, and easy to use. 

## String Operations

Here are some basic operations that you can perform on strings:

* Initialization: Create a string with given value
* Accessing Characters: Access a character by its index (zero-based)
* Updating Characters: Update a character by its index
* Traversal: Visit all characters of the string
* Length: Get the number of characters in the string
* Substring: Extract a portion of the string
* Comparison: Compare two strings for equality
* Reversal: Reverse the order of characters in the string
* Uppercase: Convert all characters in the string to uppercase
* Lowercase: Convert all characters in the string to lowercase
