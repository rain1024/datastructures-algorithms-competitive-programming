[C++](/concepts/cpp/two-pointers/README.md),
Java,
Python,
Typescript

The two pointers technique is a technique used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It is a technique that involves using two pointers to iterate through a data structure. The two pointers can be used to keep track of the current position in the data structure, or to keep track of the current range of values in the data structure.

## ü§î When to Use

* When you need to iterate through a data structure and keep track of the current position in the data structure.
* When you need to iterate through a data structure and keep track of the current range of values in the data structure.
