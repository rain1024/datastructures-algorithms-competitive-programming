In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values, with two main operations: `Add`, which adds a value to the set, and `Contains`, which checks if a value is in the set.

## Set Operations 

Here are some basic operations that you can perform on set:

* `Add`: Add a value to the set
* `Contains`: Check if a value is in the set
* `Remove`: Remove a value from the set
* `Union`: Return a new set that contains all the elements of the first set and the second set
* `Intersection`: Return a new set that contains only the elements that are present in both sets
* `Difference`: Return a new set that contains only the elements that are present in the first set and not in the second set
