In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations: `Push`, which adds an element to the collection, and `Pop`, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

## Stack Operations 

Here are some basic operations that you can perform on stacks:

* `push(item)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
* `pop()`: Removes the top item from the stack.
* `peek()`: Returns the top of the stack.
* `isEmpty()`: Returns true if and only if the stack is empty.
* `size()`: Returns the number of items in the stack.
